# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for integrating Stellar blockchain smart contracts into the marketplace platform. The system will enable secure escrow transactions, crowdfunding pools, peer-to-peer payments, and fiat currency on/off-ramping through Soroban smart contracts. The platform aims to provide a decentralized, trustless marketplace experience superior to traditional platforms like Upwork and Fiverr by leveraging Stellar's blockchain technology.

4. WHEN an escrow contract is created, THE Escrow System SHALL lock the specified funds in the smart contract until release conditions are met
5. WHEN release conditions are satisfied, THE Escrow System SHALL automatically transfer funds to the designated recipient within 60 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to receive payments automatically when milestones are completed, so that I can get paid fairly without delays or disputes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a milestone is marked complete by the project owner, THE Escrow System SHALL release the associated payment amount to the service provider's wallet
2. IF a milestone completion is disputed, THEN THE Escrow System SHALL hold funds until dispute resolution is confirmed
3. WHEN a time-based payment date arrives, THE Escrow System SHALL automatically release the scheduled payment amount

5. WHEN a payment is released, THE Escrow System SHALL update the contract state to reflect the new balance and payment history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to contribute to crowdfunding pools for projects, so that I can support multiple projects and potentially earn returns

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project enables crowdfunding, THE Escrow System SHALL create a crowdfunding pool contract with a funding goal and deadline
2. WHEN an investor contributes to a pool, THE Escrow System SHALL accept the contribution and update the pool's total raised amount

4. IF the funding goal is not reached by the deadline, THEN THE Escrow System SHALL enable contributors to withdraw their contributions
5. WHEN pool funds are distributed, THE Escrow System SHALL allocate payments according to the project's milestone or time-based schedule

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to connect my preferred Stellar wallet, so that I can manage my funds using the wallet I trust
