# Wallet Connection Fix Applied ✅

## Problem
The wallet connection was failing with error:
```
Error: Wallet id "freighter" is not supported
```

## Root Cause
The `StellarWalletsKit` was being initialized with an empty modules array:
```typescript
modules: [], // ❌ No wallet modules loaded!
```

This meant no wallet providers (Freighter, Albedo, Lobstr, xBull) were actually loaded into the kit.

## Solution Applied
Updated `lib/stellar/wallet.ts` to load all available wallet modules:

```typescript
import { allowAllModules } from '@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit';

kit = new StellarWalletsKit({
  network,
  selectedWalletId: FREIGHTER_ID,
  modules: allowAllModules(), // ✅ Load all wallet modules
});
```

## What This Does
The `allowAllModules()` function automatically loads:
- ✅ Freighter wallet module
- ✅ xBull wallet module  
- ✅ Albedo wallet module
- ✅ Lobstr wallet module

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Your Dev Server
The Next.js dev server should have automatically reloaded. If not, restart it:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Your Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### 3. Check Console
You should now see:
```
Supported wallets: [
  { id: 'freighter', name: 'Freighter', isAvailable: true/false },
  { id: 'xbull', name: 'xBull', isAvailable: true/false },
  ...
]
```

### 4. Test Wallet Connection
1. Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. You should see available wallets (not all showing as unavailable)
3. If you have Freighter installed, it should show as available
4. Click on Freighter to connect
5. Approve the connection in Freighter popup
6. Your address and balance should appear

## Expected Behavior

### With Freighter Installed
- ✅ Freighter shows as "Available"
- ✅ Can click to connect
- ✅ Freighter popup appears
- ✅ After approval, wallet connects successfully

### Without Freighter Installed
- ℹ️ Freighter shows as "Not installed"
- ℹ️ Clicking shows toast: "Please install Freighter wallet first"
- ℹ️ "Get Wallet" button opens Freighter website

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing errors?
1. **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Clear cache**: Open DevTools → Application → Clear storage
3. **Restart dev server**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

### Freighter not detected?
1. Make sure Freighter extension is installed
2. Check that Freighter is set to **Testnet** mode
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser console for any extension errors

### Connection approved but not working?
1. Check that Freighter is on Testnet (not Mainnet)
2. Make sure you have testnet XLM (use Friendbot if needed)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

## Next Steps

Once wallet connection works:
1. ✅ Test creating an escrow contract
2. ✅ Test creating a crowdfunding pool
3. ✅ Test P2P transactions
4. ✅ Monitor transactions on Stellar Expert

## Contract Addresses (Testnet)
Your deployed contracts are ready to use:
- **Escrow**: `CCHB55PCNAI7WMIA734J2G4HD4EPQK7CMH2QZSLY7KVKV3RN65RYSTEZ`
- **Crowdfunding**: `CCQX6L5DNYBLIQEB6QJYVEZFVGQGZVVTJIH3E2ABIA5EQR4B7WHXMXFF`
- **P2P**: `CAGKOAQ3N2YNURTU3WXSQN7XNLQMPAK6CZ2CPUSDSWVNAWUTASLBNPOT`
