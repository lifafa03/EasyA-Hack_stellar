## Testing Recommendations

### Screen Reader Testing
- Test with NVDA (Windows)
- Test with JAWS (Windows)
- Test with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- Test with TalkBack (Android)

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
- Verify all interactive elements are reachable via Tab key
- Test form submission with Enter key
- Test dialog dismissal with Escape key
- Verify focus indicators are visible
- Test arrow key navigation in lists and tabs

### High Contrast Mode Testing
- Enable Windows High Contrast mode
- Enable macOS Increase Contrast
- Verify all text is readable
- Verify focus indicators are visible
- Verify status indicators are distinguishable

### Automated Testing Tools
- axe DevTools browser extension
- WAVE browser extension
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Pa11y command-line tool

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

### Level A Criteria Met
- ✅ 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Alt text for all images/icons)
- ✅ 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Semantic HTML and ARIA)
- ✅ 2.1.1 Keyboard (All functionality via keyboard)
- ✅ 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Skip links and landmarks)
- ✅ 3.3.1 Error Identification (Clear error messages)
- ✅ 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (ARIA labels and roles)

### Level AA Criteria Met
- ✅ 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Text contrast ratios)
- ✅ 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Descriptive labels)
- ✅ 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Visible focus indicators)
- ✅ 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (Error recovery guidance)
- ✅ 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Confirmation for financial transactions)

## Known Limitations

1. **Iframe Content**: The interactive popup uses an iframe for anchor services. Accessibility within the iframe depends on the anchor provider's implementation.

2. **Dynamic Content**: Some content is loaded dynamically. Screen reader users should be aware that content may update.

3. **Complex Interactions**: Multi-step flows may require additional orientation for first-time users.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add skip links for faster navigation
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
3. Add preference for reduced motion
4. Provide audio feedback for transaction completion
5. Add more detailed help text and tooltips
6. Implement focus management for complex interactions
